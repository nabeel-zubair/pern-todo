# pern-todo app

A basic Todo App made using PERN stack

Hello everyone,

I created a small Todo app using PERN stack. Super helpful if you're learning about how full stack applications work and the PERN stack, in particular.

Credits go to [The Stoic Programmers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAPuqvFWmUg_gc_AZHUBPsA) for creating an amazing tutorial on this!



Feel free to play around with the code. Happy coding :)
